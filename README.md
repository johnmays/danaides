# Danaides

The Dana√Ødes were princesses of Libya who were ordered to kill their husbands by their father. Upon obliging, they were sent to Tartarus and given the task of filling up a pithos by carrying water up from the river.  However, they were given sieves, and thus doomed to labor with their sieves for eternity.  Much like them, this tool is meant to sieve for eternity.  It does so once-a-day via GitHub Actions, and it sieves the dead and inactive links from the list of songs that my portfolio website's random song recommender uses.
